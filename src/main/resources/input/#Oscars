I only wish so people would have gotten their dream match of Austin vs Hogan, even if I never cared to see it. But again, loved Rock/Hogan.
I really hate that Austin had to be wasted vs Scott Hall at X8. Rock vs Hogan was the right call, even I loved it. But triple threat? I wish
People ask me why I don't need any story in wrestling. Well WWE had Edge & Booker T wrestle at WM over shampoo. Shit like this is why.
"Maybe Flair will have a relapse on that broken back in this match." Damn, King could go really dark out of nowhere sometimes.

I remember watching a @JimLee interview about Moebius but I'm not 100% sure. I think from a French program.
Before the end of 2017, I hope we get more #PoisonIvy from @DCComicsHopefully written by @GailSimone#PoisonIvyLeague
@GailSimone can you pretty please get a poison ivy solo going? I mean she's exactly what we need in the world right now  #poisonivyleaguepic.twitter.com/mdxHa1PhEP
We can change this. Ask your fav comic writer for some more solo Poison Ivy adventures. Make a question with #poisonivyleague & I'll RT
@ivygirl851 I don't get why she's not seen as a anti hero
@ivygirl851 For all the positive reasons you just listed. Those, to the old guard, are a threat. #PoisonIvy #DCComics
Feminism, activism, environmentalism, equality, women's rights, STEM women, LGBTQ issues. I don't get why she isn't used in DC books.
Poison Ivy represents everything alt right and neo Nazis hate. It's  a shame she is absent from comics. #PoisonIvyLeague #poisonivypic.twitter.com/tecbbPH4iD

@ivygirl851 I miss the Ivy from No Man's Land that saved and protected people in Robinson's Park. Good stuff.
@ivygirl851 you're welcome. Ivy has always been one of my faves and she deserves the same space they've given other members the DCU.
@ivygirl851 I'd love to see #PoisonIvy team up with #Metamorpho and #Vixen (if it's Ivy PLUS 3, I'd also add in #Firestorm). #DCComics
@ivygirl851 I'd have her lead a team of Floronic Man & Black Orchid.https://twitter.com/ivygirl851/status/840252287071211522 …

Also, S/O to Brie Larson's character for not being the damsel in distress slowing the team down in this movie. I loved that. #kong
Another great #Kong that I recommend to see! Instant action filled with surprises!… https://www.instagram.com/p/BRfJBGwFdSP/ 
In general, #Kong was great! I want to see it again. Maybe this time I won't jump so much. Lol 
Probably for the first time ever, I wanted Sam Jackson's character to die. #kong
S/O to @twhiddleston and his sexy blue shirt. He's awesome as always. Should have kept the beard tho. It's really sexy. #Kong
One, for about the first half hour, #Kong looks like it may possibly be trash. It moves a little too fast. You'll be fine. It gets better.
This was better than any King Kong movie and I actually liked the one with jack black but this was WAYYY BETTER OMG  #KONG
#Kong messed me up! Still can't catch my breathe, and I'm pretty sure I'll be dreaming about #thebigone chasing me around an island tonight!

FULL TIME: A tale of two halves for Gate today who looked good first half but crumbled in the second half. #upthegatepic.twitter.com/uSGYJXRykH









90’ Freekick from AFC is superbly tipped over by Griffith...
SUB: OFF B.Seear ON M. Rothwell
69’ AFC have a fourth goal. Much like in the reverse fixture, Leamey produces a fine finish. 4-2
68’ Corner for AFC who look a lot more confident after taking the lead...
64’ AFC take the lead. White pumps the ball upto the striker and Griffith and Alexander leave it for each other for an easy finish. 3-2
62’ Penalty to the homeside, Alexander seemed to fall into the AFC attacker...
58’ Here’s Seydou’s header to put Gate 2-1 up!pic.twitter.com/Rmt6asWkYX

... Noblets Freekick goes straight into the keepers arms. 1-1
51’ Foul on Penswick leaves Gate with a good chance from a Freekick...
Back underway for the second half...
Gate are back out first here, just waiting for our hosts...
HT - AFC Liverpool 1-1 Squires Gate
35’ AFC Blaze over the back from inside the box after good work from the winger to get a cross in. 1-1

You on FIFA @bakiBalboa?
In the meantime follow here, @ElPasoReds and @bakiBalboa for LFC, general soccer and miscellaneous hot takes
Don't worry though, because when he comes back, the Gringos will return with a vengeance. Not like a bad vengeance though. Good vengeance
Well, one of the Gringos, @bakiBalboa is off in a far away land right now so the show is on a brief (9 month) hiatus
Some of you are probably out there wondering, "What happened to Two Red Gringos? I need LFC analysis and shit jokes! Entertain me, damnit!"
If Emre Can wants £70k, or even £80k, a week I don't see what the issue is with #LFC?
We didn't win a game in January, won one in February, and we're 4 points behind 2nd incredible
Did that #barcapsg result buy Wenger a lifeline?
Saw the result earlier but... #Barca... Holy shit.
Love of armed troops' commitment isn't - and shouldn't be - entangled with blind patriotism for those who have never been offended by it.
I feel comfortable that I can continue to support our Gringo @bakiBalboa and find sympathy with those who are angered by our country/history

For perspective, it's worth mentioning Danny Ings is on a higher wage than Emre Can. End of the day, none of us are that arsed about wages.

On Sunday we need Moreno and Mané to start IMO
On Sunday we'll...1. Have 99% possessionOn Sunday we need...1. Fast players willing to run at the Burnley defence to win free kicks/Pen
One thing for sure we'll have more of the ball, but we need speed, play Mané & Moreno to help unlock the Burnley defence IMO
Should we start Moreno instead of Milner, considering he is a faster attacking threat?
The reason why we have not been able to break teams like Burnley is because our FBs don't attack well enough & cross inviting balls in...
Against Burnley, do we trust Mané to dash at the defence to win a penalty or free kick?
If Firmino doesn't start in Sunday, it means Origi will play as our "9"
Should we play a 3-4-3 against Burnley on Sunday? How do we break down a stubborn defence??
The one thing I wouldn't want at #LFC next season..."Rehab players"

Klopp: "Sturridge and Henderson both not available. Firmino is struggling a bit. He couldn't train. We have to wait."#LFC
Klopp: "Nobody should expect an easy game. We have to be ready for the fight that we face."#LFC
Klopp: "Burnley's away record is not good but it's not that they've had no chances. We just have to be ready for hard work."#LFC
Klopp: "Ragnar Klavan has had some wonderful games. We will see what we do with Dejan Lovren. No decision yet."#LFC
Klopp on having to regularly change his CBs: "I have no time to be frustrated. If someone is injured you have to find a solution."#LFC
Klopp on Milner: "He has adapted to a lot of positions in his life. 600 is quite a number. He doesn't look like he's played 600."#LFC
Klopp: "I'm still full of joy for this job."#LFC
Klopp: "We have struggled in moments when we have had a lot of injuries. But atmosphere within the club is fantastic."#LFC
Klopp on reaching 100pts at LFC: "I've learned a lot about the league, the club and the players. We are able to play good football."#LFC

Decent night for #mufc. Away goal. No injuries (reported so far). Rojo excellent. But Pogba disappointing.
Good control & finish by Bukharov but wonderful pass from Kalachev & wretched defending by Jones #ROSMUN
Those with good technique like Zlatan & Mkhitaryan can cope with substandard pitches like this cabbage patch built on sand. Still dangerous.
Shawcross embodies #scfc organisation, #mcfc miss Sterling and #cfc move closer to title. Report from the Etihadhttp://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/guardiola-left-frustrated-by-stifling-stoke-0rgdks5ln …
#scfc resilient, disciplined. Grant assured. Shawcross marshalled the defence well. Allen composed. Walters ran himself into the ground.
Writing 1100 words on #mcfc 0 #scfc 0 while keeping one eye on monitor showing Barcelona's epic comeback attempt.
0-0 h-t. #mcfc missing the invention of David Silva & the urgency, movement, pace and assists of Sterling. #scfc compact & could have scored

10-2 agg. Vidal again. 10-2. Kroenke needs to get a grip of a club in crisis. 10-2.
4-1 Bayern. Vidal. Abject defending.
Mass exodus now. Douglas Costa makes it 3-1 Bayern. Humiliation for Wenger.

Ralph Macchio is in 3 amazing films. Karate Kid, Crossroads, My Cousin Vinny.
Karate Kid - Daniel's Training "WAX ON WAX OFF"https://youtu.be/Bg21M2zwG9Q 
The scene in which Mr. Miyagi shows Daniel that he's secretly been teaching him karate all along is phenomenal.
Mr. Miyagi is the best mentor in all of film. Who are some others?
I study successful people. They all say to act immediately when you know the path you need to take -- immediately meaning within seconds.

Damien Chazelle interview on "La La Land" with Jon Favreau (2016) Falling asleep to this tonight.https://youtu.be/z1F5GQsoLtY 
Fury Road is maybe one of the best action movies ever. It's so much more than just an action film.
George Miller: "We learned to read films, & half a century later we're speed readers." Explains editing style on Fury Road.
Favreau to Downey Jr. about studio's disinterest in him for Iron Man: "It's not gonna happen." Downey Jr.: "I disagree. I think it will."
Jon Favreau's best film:

@iamjeffemmerson  #ADHD
発達障害（特にＡＤＨＤ）の欠点回避策の共通点①行える対策の総数には限界がある②自分が特に困ることに絞って行うと良い③手帳・ケースなど物理的な何かに頼るといい。さもないと、いつか忘れてうやむやになる。④なにがしかの理由でルーチンが変わる日は要注意#発達障害　#adhd
確定申告の季節でございますね。私のような #ADHD 民は毎月の診察・処方代及びお薬代がかさみます。自治体に申請して自立支援医療制度を利用されて自己負担額を抑えている方もいらっしゃいましょうが、それでもかかる費用、まともな生活を営むためとは言えなかなか頭の痛い問題でございます。

Υπάρχουν συναισθήματα που δεν έχεις κανένα δικαίωμα να νιώσεις κι όμως σε πονάνε στον ύψιστο βαθμό
pic.twitter.com/sUmWduvYrX
Δώσε μου μια δεύτερη ευκαιρία να σου γαμήσω ότι άφησα όρθιο την πρώτη φορά
Τη γυναίκα να την φροντίζετε όσο την έχετε. Μόλις νιώσει δεδομένη θα φύγει παλικάρια και τότε είναι αργά
Φόβοι, αβεβαιότητα, άγχος για ένα μέλλον που φαντάζει αβεβαιο
Ζωή στο κλουβί με τις τρελές
Έρχεται ο άλλος και μου μισοκρύβει την πιπιλιά στο λαιμό. Σιγά μην κλάψω μάτια μου, λαμπάδα θα ανάψω
Ο φόβος για το αύριοΟ μεγαλύτερος εχθρός της ανάπτυξης μας
Όσο δειλό σε κάνει η συνήθεια δεν σε κάνει τίποτα άλλο
Άκου το πάλι να το εμπεδώσεις: εσύ φταις που τον έχεις κακομάθει
Μεγάλη ανακούφιση να βρίσκεις έναν άνθρωπο που θέλει να σε ακούσει
Ωρολογιακή βόμβα έτοιμη για έκρηξη... αυτό είμαστε
Φιλαράκι αν αναλαμβάνεις μία ευθύνη κουβάλα την για όλο το δρόμο
Αισιόδοξη με βρίσκω. Ας δω ειδήσεις
Κάθε μέρα μία νίκη και μία ήττα μαζί. Ελπίδες για ένα καλύτερο αύριο που κάθε μέρα φουντώνουν
Μόνη μου ταξιδεύω όμως έχω επιβάτες που πρέπει να φροντίσω
Δεμένη στο αδιέξοδο προσπαθώ να πολεμήσω...
Το ένα πόδι εδώ και το άλλο ήδη στο δρόμο....

Los Angelenos, do get out and vote today and wear that sticker with pride.
The big program is on tonight and it is a GOOD'N.  Feast yourself on the epic to the intimate, w/pathos, humor, and badassery!
I do encourage to watch the big Walking Dead program tonight, as it's an epic tale of good, evil, video games, walkers, and pickles.

I'd like to repeat: Tomorrow is the last day to enroll in Obamacare. If you enroll, youll be covered for 1 year, even if they repeal the ACA
Aaaand @beckysaysrawr's "A Closed and Common Orbit" is  terrific, warm, and mind rending,  as well. You have some fine reading ahead of you.
If you like sci-fi and/or people and/or fun thought provocation @beckysaysrawr's "The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet" is a terrific read.

Not even for a millisecond. RT @pinkgold1133: @seanflanery Did u ever think at some point that bjj was too hard for u to learn?
Same ones for 7-99. RT @MaryAnnHodnett: @seanflanery What core foundation  elements do you teach in BJJ for ages 4-6?
Only when I'm chewing on leather. RT @SlcBMXgirl: @seanflanery Ever feel like your chewing on leather?  @SunshineSunny00
The counterfeit kind, yes. RT @hshea8: @seanflanery Can someone's love/friendship be bought?
Later, my little slices of homie! RT @Regeon1Dubois: @seanflanery Well, Boss...Until next time, bye!
Duh. RT @jaydnlwb: @seanflanery Is the "Funky Chicken" a Flanery original?
Maslow > TMZ. RT @ercoul1: @seanflanery If you had to choose between fame or self awareness, which would you pick for yourself?

I don't dream about them. RT @pinkgold1133: @seanflanery What is your dream motorcycle?
You either want it... or you don't. RT @_kaitlynn_98: Struggling with dieting and loosing weight to get into the Air Force after high school
Live seven sevenths. RT @SlcBMXgirl: @seanflanery Any thoughts or advise for the weekend? 
Balls were kicked. RT @tammycyw: almost a year since we took off to NY 2 days notice and it was worth every momentpic.twitter.com/QBkhDDgcG8
My pleasures laugh at guilt. RT @ReedusFan79:  Do you have a "Guilty pleasure" book that you love to read but would never admit to?
I think "conscious uncoupling" is most likely only ever due to unconscious coupling. RT @beach_girl_barb: @seanflanery Random thought?
I know the Tana river did. RT @JessiBlue82: @seanflanery do still waters really run deep?
None. Most people DO give up right before the finish line. RT @SaraJStew: @seanflanery Any thoughts on Nurmagomedov possibly retiring?
No... but there is nothing glamorous about poverty. RT @beach_girl_barb: @seanflanery Does money really change everything?
Remember & bottle it's cause. RT @cinderellaTWD: What to do, if you just can't stop laughing & you're not able to put away the giggle box?

Me: I want to check the mail, but I'm basically drunk. What should I do?My dad: Look both ways before you cross the street.#lifelessons
At home, pyjamas on, wine in hand. Record time! 
Thighs like honey; thick and sweet. #lifegoals
I try on my new bikini in the dead of winter, with pale skin, after a long week of eating treats at work parties because why not.
Just heard it's #middlenamepride day...I have always been very proud of mine; my grandpa's name!
It has been difficult to "give up dating" for #Lent, as going on #POF is a good time waster...but I guess that is the whole point of this.
Yep. Still #Fit(ish)pic.twitter.com/HhPdGMMpQP
Have you stalked your TCs account today?
Thanks @Tuckermeg for turning me onto the meatball parm bowties! The garlic and olive oil pasta chips are also to die!

Can heated foot pedals be a thing?
Think I have overdone it. Popped to Advil and off to bed. Who is good at upper buttock massage?
On empty. Too cold to get gas. You may find me on the side of Highway 2a.

Hiddleston in #Kong gahddamn. His script (and Brie's) prolly just 3 pages long (lol) but damn he looked fwwineeeeee.
#Kong ~ mindless fun as a creature feature, i guess? Overall i like Peter Jackson's more. Post credit scene is the real winner tho.

最後の課題はいまの単純なファイルシステムを拡張して4.2BSDくらいのファイルシステムを実装しろというもの。なんかバッファーキャッシュはあっさり実装できた。
こんなカスなコード書いてるなんてと思うとパワーがゼロになるタイプなので自己満足でいいです。残念だけど仕方がない。
夜によくビールとか飲みながらコード眺めて「これはよく書けてるな〜」と感心して味わってるくらいプログラムそのものがわりと好きなんだけど、それが自分の書いたコード読んでたりするいうのはちょっとアレ。なんというか明石家さんまが自分の番組をみて笑ってるという話と同じくらいおかしい。
前回はカーネルスレッドのレースコンディションで猛烈に大変なデバッグをするはめになったから今回はロックじゃなくてチャネルと通信を使って同期するようにしよ。もうあれはこりごり。
この教授一番最初に持ってたコンピュータはテープからプログラムを読んでいたし次のApple IIではフロッピーで、とか言ってるわりに見た目が30代後半くらいに見える。

まだ手をつけてないのに次の締め切りまで10日切ってるじゃんか。
出張中の食費75ドルまでならレシートすら不要って結構すごくない？
仕事でもOSDev Wikiを見て学校でもOSDev Wikiを見てるのに気づいて笑ってしまった。
普通に上位二、三割に入ってればいいでしょくらいだとこんなに根を詰めなくてもいいんだけど。まあある意味趣味の世界なので。あとどうしても取れそうなバグがあるとムキになって何時間でも費やしてしまう。
10分前にして最終版を提出！ 今回の宿題はちょっと考えられないレベルで大変だったぞ。CS143, CS243, CS107とかプログラミング課題大変系はかなりこなしてきたはずなんだがCS140はやばい。
中1日で24時間コーディングになってしまった。でもまあ結構楽しい。
はー、電気復活。劇的すぎて笑ったわ。早くサブミットしよ。
締切まであと3時間のところでいきなり家が停電。まだ提出してないよ！ まじか！
そういや昔は趣味のプログラミングでも眠気の限界までがんばって徹夜で書いたりしてた。なぜあんなにやる気があったのか。今でもあるっちゃあるけど。
さっきから悩んでた、たまにテストが挙動不審な問題、make -j checkってやってたのが原因ぽい。この-j unsafeなmakefile書いたやつ許さん！ ていうか課題のmakefile常に腐っているのはなぜだ。
あと12時間で完成させるぞ。気合いが充実している。
かなりいい感じにできあがってきたとは思うけどすでに必要なら徹夜も辞さない覚悟。
やべえ、ダミーで自分の昔の原稿30ページくらいを入れてXamarin本のPDFを作っていたのだけど、まだ全部揃っていないのに既に230ページある…!

Now it's time to #LetLessigDebate!
Melbourne Metro just did an #IWD shout out over their PA. It won't change the world but it was nice to hear.
If you believe women are equal so you don't need to acknowledge #IWD, I trust you also don't acknowledge Anzac Day because we aren't at war.
We asked @leighsales @SummersAnne @clementine_ford @WainBright which woman changed the way they think for #IWD2017 http://ab.co/2myPhzm pic.twitter.com/1GrkncNVdR

@clementine_ford Hundreds of men will now be unable to cross the road, because they're not going to do what a woman says.
Some walk signals are being changed to pictures supposedly depicting women and men everywhere lose their minds. But women r so dramatic.

Truth. #qandapic.twitter.com/3kGsrw7g8w
People are more comfortable viewing girls as potential victims than viewing boys as potential perps #qanda
We need to specifically educate boys not to feel entitled to abuse women. #qanda
It shouldn't be brave for men to care about issues affecting women. #qanda
No one ever discusses the poor health of starving your body or hating your body. #qanda
I don't think @ThordisElva's approach has to be prescriptive or followed by anyone. This is just her story. #qanda
Point of order. @ThordisElva didn't "get raped".  Tom Stranger raped her. Language matters. #qanda
There is literally no question about whether or not Trump is a misogynist or a racist. He is both, and proud of it. #qanda

Criticism is a great thing. It makes you better at what you do. I dunno. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment or something.
Then again, I come from a sphere where I was often called racist, sexist, misogynistic and far worse so my skin might be a tad thicker.

@AlisonSpalding2 @Bern4prez2016 @veggietrunks @LetLessigDebate Don't forget @DWStweets led DNC to change #DemDebate rules to exclude @lessig
@AndrewOkuneff the survey had Lessig for months. Think you should open more of our emails. @lessig @Lessig2016 @LetLessigDebate

أغلفة زيلدا و 1-2 سويتش بالتقييم العمري من الهيئة العامة للإعلام المرئي و المسموع @gcamsapic.twitter.com/Vh9kmdgMWR
اطلاق السويتش كنه اطلاق زيلدا للامانه، الجهاز ما نسمع غير عن مشاكله والعبء كله على اللعبه، الخوف تتفاقم المشكلة بعد ما ينتهي وهج اللعبة.
صح اني ماشتريت السويتش علشان زيلدا ،  ولكن الحمدلله اتعوضت اني اشتريت اللعبة على الوي يو علشان نعيش العالم الساحر الخرافي  pic.twitter.com/zNSZAXLMNs
هورايزن اللعبة رقم واحد ببريطانيا وتغلب زيلدا بفارق مريح + أكبر لنش لـNew IP من سوني وأكبر لنش للعبة من سوني منذ أنشارتد٤!!
الفرق بين نسخة الوي يو والسويتش للعبة زيلدا كلها على 30 فريم ونفس المحتوىالسويتش 900p والمحمول والوي يو 720pالاصوات افضل على السويتش
الحين عرفت ليش فهد قارن زيلدا ب ميتل قير 5 @Hyo_Joestarpic.twitter.com/roLUFKKOPs
ما عليكم بأنقذ زيلدا، بس عطوني خمس دقايق زيادة ! pic.twitter.com/gt1v3ODTl4
بستغرب من العالم المتعصبة لهورايزون أو زيلدا. ما بتقدر تلعب الاثنين؟ أنا بخلص هورايزون ﻋﻠﻰ بلايستيشن، وببدا بزيلدا ﻋﻠﻰ Wii U.
أتذكر أن زيلدا فيتزجيرالد كتبت مرة "لم يقم أحد بقياس الكم الذي يمكن للقلب تحمله"
بالمناسبة ماعندي مشكلة مع اللي يفضل زيلدا على جميع الألعاب هذا حقه لكن اللي يفاضل الألعاب عن طريق التقاييم اغسل يدك ورجولك منه وقل له سلاما

The most left wing voters who care most about racial justice issues are young voters (all colors) not older minority voters
Its speaking with a broad brush but most of those voters arent that ideological or that progressive
Media people lapped it up because they dont actually go out and talk to voters, had no idea it had nothing to do with say black lives matter
Most of those voters were voting based on legacy support for B clinton who was hardly considerate on these matters, more the economy of 90s
Their claim that they had such an overwhelming amount of support from black voters 45 years and above was by itself absolution was silly
This was 1 of those things that stood out to me during the primary is Clintonites kept playing race card but didnt really care
Trump primary voters were energized by dehumanizing Muslims. Bernie voters were repulsed. Clinton voters didnt care. http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/3/7/14456154/dehumanization-psychology-explained …pic.twitter.com/1TzYIdEIlr

اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ الَّذِي خَلَقْتَنِي فَأَنْتَ تَهْدِينِ ، وَأَنْتَ الَّذِي تُطْعِمُنِي وَتَسْقِينِ ، وَإذَا مَرِضْتُ فَأَنْتَ تَشْفِينِ
اسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ العَظِيمَ الَّذِي لاَ إلَهَ إلاَّ هُوَ، الحَيُّ القَيُّومُ، وَأتُوبُ إلَيهِ#_astgfer_
اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْ خَيْرَ عُمُرِي أَوَاخِرَهُ ، وَخَيْرَ عَمَلِي خَوَاتِمَهُ ، وَخَيْرَ أَيَّامِي يَوْمَ لِقَاكَ.
جنبني يالله ان اكون عالة وخسارة وعقبة وصديق سوء وباب فشل واحتمال اخير وخيار ثاني وطرف ثالث ، وانّ لا اقضي عمري منتظرًا للفراغ

«العمل» تبرم اتفاقية لإعداد «الميثاق الأخلاقي» للقطاع الأهليhttp://ift.tt/2iq4Oxk #اقتصاد_الجزيرة#اقتصاد#الاقتصاد#الجزيرة
الليبرالية تعني الحرية و التحرر من القيود السلطوية الثلاثة (السياسية والاقتصادية والثقافية)، (الهبوط الأخلاقي الى المستوى الحيواني )
مقدار كميّة الحب في هذا الزمان تعتمد على وضعك الاجتماعي والمالي لا وضعك الديني و الاخلاقيهدا حالنا اليوم 
الخلاصة: لا يمكن أن نشيد الفعل الأخلاقي إلا على الدين ، ومع ذلك فليس الدين والأخلاق شيئًا واحدًا .
التكفير.. البعد الأخلاقي والتربوي. http://alwasateah.blogspot.com/2014/03/blog-post_5524.html … #الغلو #الجهاد #الحسبة #التكفير #درر
أخي المرحوم هادي تعلمنا منك التطور الأخلاقي وحب الخير وتخطينا بفضلك بعدالله حاجز الوسائل التقليديه للعمل الإنساني (رحمك الله)
المسيري أيضا يقول أن في الصراع من أجل البقاء "المادي" لا يفوز الأفضل "بالمعنى الأخلاقي"،وإنما الأقوى والأكثر تكيفا مع القوانين المادية
فالسلوك الأخلاقي يحتمل في معناه اختيارين فقط إما أنه لا معنى له ، وإما أن له معنى في وجود الله .
@kamnapp@MOISaudiArabia إلى الأمير محمد بن نايفنعلمانك لا ترضى بهذا الأنحلال الأخلاقيونثق بأنك ستحاسبهم#قناه_يوتيرن_شذوذ_وايحات_جنسيهpic.twitter.com/mwtNXSqNZN
لماذا لم يتم إبرام اتفاق الميثاق اﻷخلاقي للعاملين في المجال المهني في نفس الوزارة. https://twitter.com/masdar_saudi/status/815222331647791104 …
اذا تهيأت للسلام تفعل فأغريت بي فضوول رفااقي ، هبك أهملت وااجبي سلفاً منك فما ذنب واجب الأخلاقي؟!
إن الشخص الأخلاقي ليس هو مَن يفعل ما يأتي على نحو طبيعي ومألوف، بل ما يتضمن صراعًا داخليًا مع الرغبات الشريرة.- #كانط

البارسا اليوم كتب اعظم حدث بتاريخ كرة القدم، هذه الليلة سيتم ذكرها حتى بعد ٥٠ سنة من الان. نحن شاهدناها مباشرة
الليلُ أطول شيء حين أفقِدهُ ، والليلُ أقصر شيء حين ألقاهُ.
الحياة أقصر من أن نعود فيها لنفس الأشخاص، و أطول من أن لا نعود لهم فيها.

فتحتو دواوينكم للتبرعات للدواعش وجبهة النصره مالم تفتحوها للبدون فالاقربون اولي بالمعروف لاتنسونهم فابائهم ركبو الدبابات وانتم بفنادق ٥ نجوم
حينما جاءها خبر استشهاد أبنائها واحدا تلو الآخر لم تشعر بالفجيعة..لكن حينما جاءها خبر استشهاد الحسين خارت قواها حتى تقطع نياط قلبها ألما..
عجيب أمر هذه المرأة التي هي بألف رجل أو يزيدون في شجاعتها وحملها ثقل الأمانة وتفانيها في حفظها والاخلاص في ذلك ومدى احتمال ذلك التكليف ...
@ndream2 العســر بضيچ ماينحمل مره.....اوصيك على باب الفرج مره.....انا توجهت ل ام عباس مره ...قريت الفاتحه وفرجت عليه 
إن حمل الأمانة ثقيل جداوكذلك فعلت أم البنين حينما حملت أمانة سيدة نساء العالمين في احتضان سيدا شباب الجنة وزينب وأم كلثومفما أعظم الأمانة
ليتنا جميعا نتعلم من سيرة أم البنين ع السلام؛كيف يختار الرجل الزوجة الصالحةوكيف تكون الأم الودودوكيف يكون الصبر على البلاءوحفظ الأمانة
لم تحزن أم البنين على فقدها أبنائها بقدر حزنها وأساها وفجيعتها بفقدها الحسين ربيبها..لأنها قد تكفلت برعايته وكانت تعتبره أمانة الزهراء لها.
أم البنين ع السلام أنجبت للإمام علي عليه السلام أربع أولاد كانوا سندا لأبيهم واخوتهم منه لاسيما في واقعة كربلاء فأفنوا أنفسهم فداء للحسين..
أم البنين كانت المرأة التي وصفها الامام علي بأنها بنت الفحول .. أي أنها وصفت بأنها من أصل وفصل ونسل اتصف بالشجاعة والمروءة والذكاء والقوة..
@ndream2 ولقبت بام البنين احتراما للامامين الحسن والحسين وسيدتنا زينب عليهم السلام
@ndream2 أعلى الله مقامها في الدنيا والآخرة لأن #أم_البنين سيدة ذابت في حب الله سبحانه وتعالى وقدمت حياتها وحياة أبنائها لنصرة دين الله
أم البنين؛ قليل من يعرف من هي..باختصار هي:١. زوجة الامام علي عليه السلام بعد وفاة زوجته فاطمة بنت النبي عليهم الصلاة والسلام..
اللهم لا اُضام و أنت حسبي ، و لا أفتقر و أنت ربي ، فـ أصلح لي شأني كله و لا تكلني إلى نفسي طرفة عين و لا حول و لا قوة إلا بك

رسالة لعقلاء #الشيعة #لماذا_نبغض_ايران لأني ع قناعة تامة أن إيران ستُذيق الشيعة المرّ وستُريهم حقدها عليهم بعد أن تحقّق مخططاتهم ومصالحهم
رسالة لعقلاء #الشيعة #لماذا_نبغض_ايران لأنهم لم تكن يوماً شيعية، إيران تستفيد من الفكر الشيعي لتوظيفه في مشروعها الفارسي.فلا يَستغفلنّك
